# Genoa (Mukurtu sub-theme)

This sub-theme was rebuilt after investigating some page elements which were
missing compared to the parent theme. This was accomplished by following the
Drupal 7 guide: https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/theming/creating-a-sub-theme

## Theme Settings
This theme will **not** display correctly unless the settings are set properly.

- Go to the Admin Menu > Appearance > Settings > Genoa
- Uncheck the box next to "Logo" under **Toggle Display**
- Under **MUKURTU**, click "COLOR SCHEME" to expand the menu
  - Select "No Mukurtu theme CSS"
- Click "Save configuration"

## Further Customizations
We've made numerous other customizations to Mukurtu's default configuration.
Read more about them in the [Customizations document](docs/customizations.md)

## Optimizations
Read more about [Drupal and Mukurtu optimizations](docs/optimizations.md) to
have the site perform the best for users.
